##For question 1 please refer to FactorialCalculator.java class
Stack data structure was used as asked. It was used to store factorials of previous numbers until we reached the one we were looking for. This data structure also provides useful methods such as push, peek and pop.
Please refert to FactorialCalculatorTest.java for Unit testing.

##For question 2 please refer to OperatorQueue.java class
LinkedList data structure, implementing Queue interface was chosen for this question as it maintains FIFO order
and has queue required behavior methods such as add, peek and poll.
Please refer to OperatorQueueTest.java for Unit Testing

##For question 3 please refer to ProfessionMap.java class
Since we needed a data structure based on a key and a value, Map data structure is the best option to solve this question.
Please refer to ProfessionMap.java for Unit Testing

##For question 4 please refer to ListsExercise.java class
For this exercise we need a data structure capable of traverse elements in an efficient way. List and ListIterator can help us to solve this question.

Unit tests should be run with maven.
Code is for Java 1.6 and JUnit 4.11
